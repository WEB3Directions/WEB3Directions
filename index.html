    <h2>About Lexus LFA</h2>  

   <p>
    The Lexus LFA (Japanese: レクサス・LFA, Rekusasu LFA) is a two-seat sports car manufactured by Lexus, the  luxury car division of Toyota. It is the second model in the F marque line of performance vehicles from Lexus, following the IS F,  and also the first standalone Lexus F model. Three concept versions were unveiled, each debuting at the North American International Auto Show with  the LF-A designation as part of the LF Series concept line. After beginning development in the early 2000s (with a codename of TXS), the first LF-A concept premiered in 2005, followed in 2007 by a second concept with a more completely furnished interior and exterior. The third version of the LF-A, featuring a roadster body style premiered in 2008. The production model, trademarked LFA,[3] was unveiled at the Tokyo Motor Show in October 2009.[4] According to Lexus, the "A" in production LFA name stands for the "Apex" of the LF line of cars.[5]

Akio Toyoda, CEO of parent company Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC) saw the LFA as an opportunity to create a  global icon for the Lexus brand,  embodying Toyoda's idea that the ultimate Lexus should connect with its owner.[6]

The production version of the Lexus LFA features a 412 kW (560 PS; 553 hp) V10 engine developed in collaboration with Yamaha exclusive to the car and a body made from carbon fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP). CFRP materials account for 65 percent of the LFA's body composition by mass.[7] The LFA went into production in late 2010.[8][9] A circuit-tuned variant debuted in 2012,[10] and was one of the  most expensive Japanese road cars ever built.[11] Production ended in December 2012 with 500 cars produced, the final car being a<br/>  Nürburgring Package model.[12]

In February 2016, Lexus' European boss Alain Uyttenhoven confirmed that there would be no new LFA replacement in the near future.[13]

As of 2020, Lexus still had four unsold LFAs after selling three LFAs in 2019. However, two were sold in March 2020 and another in September 2020, still, an LFA remains unsold even though the car's production ended in 2012.[14][15][16]

<h3  id="sec1"> Development  </h3>

   

      

    
2000–2004
The LF-A sports car began development with a codename of TXS, which was intended to showcase the performance capabilities of Toyota Motor Corporation and its Lexus marque.[17][18] The first prototype was completed during June 2003. Prototypes of the LF-A were spotted regularly undergoing testing at the Nürburgring, the famous motorsport race track in Nürburg, Germany,[19] since October 2004.[20] Numerous test vehicles had been equipped with automatic retractable rear spoilers, and carbon ceramic brake discs.[21]

2005–2006

The LF-A concept on display

The first Lexus LF-A concept at the 2005 Geneva Motor Show
In January 2005, the first LF-A concept premiered at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan as a design study with no plans for production. The first LF-A concept had an overall length of 4,399 mm (173.2 in), while its wheelbase measured 2,581 mm (101.6 in)[22] The concept was nearly 1,219 mm (48 in) in height, with a width of 1,859 mm (73.2 in).[22] Some news outlets reported the concept name as referring to Lexus Future-Advance,[23] a claim later dismissed by Chief Engineer Tanahashi.[24] The first LF-A concept featured a glass roof and side cameras mounted in the side mirrors. Twin rear radiators were installed behind the rear wheels, and visible behind large screens. The rear bumper featured a triple exhaust placed in an inverted triangle formation. The wheels were shaped like turbines, and air-scoops were placed on the C-pillars.[22] Following enthusiastic public reaction for the LF-A concept on the auto show circuit, development continued with a greater emphasis on a possible production model.[25] Concurrently, Lexus was preparing for the launch of its long-rumored F marque series of performance vehicles, with a production LF-A being a possible future member of this lineup. Reports in 2006 suggested that the LF-A concept car had received the green-light for production,[26] however these reports were not officially confirmed.[27]


2007–2008


The second Lexus LF-A concept

The Lexus LF-A racing concept
Following the original LF-A concept, development time was lengthened by the switch from an aluminum frame to a carbonfibre tub, the result of engineering efforts aimed at improving the LF-A's power-to-weight ratio.[17] The LF-A was reported to draw engineering resources from Toyota's Formula One team.[18] In January 2007, a restyled LF-A concept car premiered alongside the first production F marque vehicle, the IS F sports sedan. The second LF-A concept featured a more aerodynamic exterior, a near-production interior, and F marque emblems. Later that year, Lexus Great Britain director Steve Settle indicated plans for a V10 and hybrid version of the LF-A.[28] The hybrid version, combining a petrol engine with electric motors, was to feature a V8 powertrain similar to that designed for the Lexus LS 600h L. LF-A test mules continued to be spotted at the Nürburgring, including early models with a large, fixed rear wing.[25] In December 2007, Auto Express reported that the LF-A had set an unofficial 7:24 lap at the Nürburgring.[29][30]



The Lexus LF-A Roadster concept
In January 2008, Lexus displayed a roadster version of the LF-A concept car designated LF-A Roadster, or LF-AR, at the North American International Auto Show. Initial specifications for the roadster were a V10 engine having a displacement of 5.0 L and rated at over 373 kW (500 hp). The car's top speed was reported to be over 322 km/h (200 mph).[31] Automotive photographers capturing the LF-A in various test guises had photographed a disguised convertible test model, dubbed LF-A Spyder, on the Nürburgring as early as October 2005.[32] After its debut at the 2008 North American International Auto Show, the LF-A Roadster was also shown at the 2008 Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance, the 2008 Geneva Motor Show, the United States Open Championship tournament, and at Lexus exhibits in Japan. A single LF-A racing prototype was also entered into Veranstaltergemeinschaft Langstreckenpokal Nürburgring endurance races at the Nürburgring in May 2008, competing in the SP8 class of VLN events.[33] Media reports uncovered an LFA trademark filing with the United States Patent and Trademark Office in December 2008, with the concept LF-A name dropping its hyphen to become LFA for a possible production model.[3]

The second LF-A concepts had an overall length of 4,460 mm (175.6 in), and a wheelbase of 2,598 mm (102.3 in); height remained the same as the prior concept, while width grew to 1,895 mm (74.6 in).[34] While the original LF-A had been strictly a concept model, the second concept's design reflected engineering analysis for possible production.[35] The exterior design had been restyled to take advantage of the flexibility offered by carbon-fibre construction,[36] with improved aerodynamics and surface features aimed at improving the car's overall top speed.[35] The reshaped exterior featured smoother lines with additional detailing, and more curved surfaces. The aft radiator cooling vents were retained, but integrated into the rear fascia, and the lower side and front air intakes were restyled, along with the forward fascia and headlamps.[25] Designers reportedly drew inspiration from the 1965 2000GT sports coupé, which was also produced in a front-engine, rear-wheel drive layout, and represented the combination of Japanese technology and design ethics in a sports car.[36] However, no design features on the LF-A were directly derived from the 2000GT.[36] The second LF-A concept and accompanying LF-A Roadster were also equipped with a retractable rear wing for improved handling at speed and a two-seat interior with a two-tone colour scheme.

2009

The production Lexus LFA at the 2009 Tokyo Motor Show.
On 5 August 2009, Toyota's new CEO, Akio Toyoda, publicly confirmed production of the LF-A in his speech at a conference held at the Center for Automotive Research in the United States.[37] The production vehicles were expected to carry V10 engines.[38][39]

Two LF-A prototypes had also competed at Nürburgring VLN endurance races in mid-2009. In September 2009, reports in Japanese automotive magazines indicated that the 4.8 L V10 engine for the LF-A would carry a 1LR designation.[40] A subsequent television ad for the Japanese market showed the pre-production LFA testing at the Fuji Speedway.[41]

On 21 October 2009, the production version of the Lexus LFA was unveiled on the first press day of the 41st biennial Tokyo Motor Show.[9] The car was introduced by Akio Toyoda at a press conference, in which it was disclosed that the vehicle would be limited to 500 production copies. The car carried the same designation as the concepts, LFA, but without the hyphen. The production designation reportedly stood for Lexus Fuji Apex,[42] another claim dismissed by Chief Engineer Tanahashi.[24] The LFA was shown as the final vehicle of the press conference, following the LF-Ch hybrid concept.[9]

The production announcement for the LFA marked the 20th anniversary of the launch of Lexus.[43] Given the high cost of construction and development, analysts did not expect LFA sales to be profitable.[9] However, the LFA was intended to serve as a testbed for new car technologies, including carbon-fibre mass-production, and related performance vehicle development.[44] At its debut, a circuit-ready model was also indicated for a 2012 launch.<sup>[14]</sup>

   <h3  id="sec2"> Production  </h3>

   <p>
    Lexus began taking orders for the LFA on 23 October 2009. Buyers were selectively chosen by Lexus in the second quarter of 2010.[46] Production began in December 2010. Only 500 total cars were made for worldwide markets, with only 20 produced each month with a base price of $375,000 (£340,000). Each car had to be custom ordered to the customer's specifications.[47] Following the LFA's Introduction at the Tokyo Motor Show, Lexus unveiled a website with an 'LFA configurator', which allowed users to select exterior and interior colours, brake caliper colours, seats, steering wheel leather, and other interior designs.[48][49] In total, there were over 30 billion possible combinations.[49] Each LFA was hand-built by a dedicated production team of engineers and specialists at Toyota's Motomatchi plant in Aichi, Japan.[50][51][52]


Production LFAs, lined up in Yokohama
In the North American market, 150 cars were initially sold through a two-year lease program. This was to prevent owners from reselling the vehicle for a profit.[47] Racing driver Scott Pruett was hired to give test drives to interested buyers, demonstrating the vehicle's capabilities at Auto Club Speedway. The Lexus division of Toyota Motors USA stopped taking orders at the end of 2009, at which time they planned to open discussions about a purchase plan for the lessees. Lexus later changed their stance and allowed outright purchase, but only on the condition that they sign an agreement giving the dealer the first right of refusal to buy back the LFA if the owner wanted to sell it within the first two years. The dealer would have the option to buy back the used LFA for either fair market value or the original sticker price, whichever is lower.[53] In the European market, buyers could order their LFA through a single Lexus dealer located in Park Lane, London where it was purchased outright.[54]

During the LFA's production, each vehicle received an individually numbered plaque, indicating the unit's place in the production run. Each LFA V10 engine carried the signature of the specialist who assembled it.[51] With 20 units produced monthly, production of the LFA extended from December 2010 to December 2012. Production ended on 14 December 2012, with the last car finished in white exterior colour and equipped with the Nürburgring package. When production ended, no successor was scheduled. The LFA plant in Motomachi continued making parts with a small team.[55]

   <h3  id="sec3"> Engine  </h3>

   <p>
    The Lexus LFA is powered by a 72-degree bank angle 4,805 cc (4.8 L; 293.2 cu in) V10 engine equipped with Dual VVT-i carrying the 1LR-GUE designation with a maximum output of 412 kW (560 PS; 553 hp) delivered at 8,700 rpm. Its maximum torque output of 480 N⋅m (354 lb⋅ft) arrives at 6,800 rpm, 90 percent of which is available from 3,700 rpm. The engine redlines at 9,000 rpm, but with a fuel cutoff set at 9,500 rpm,[56] and is constructed using forged aluminum pistons, forged titanium connecting rods, and solid titanium valves. The V-angle of the LFA's V-10 engine is set to 72-degrees to fully balance the firing force from the pistons. This 72-degree angle allows for even firing from the pistons without the use of a split-journal crankshaft, thus improving engine efficiency as well as lowering the overall weight. Dry sump lubrication prevents engine oil starvation through high-speed corners and lowers the engine's center of mass. Air is fed directly from beneath the hood through a visible slit passing into a dual-stage variable intake manifold and then into ten individual throttle bodies before finally exiting from a dual-stage titanium muffler.


LFA Deputy Chief Engineer Chiharu Tamura explains LFA engine
The LFA's engineers selected a V10 engine over an equivalent displacement V8 engine for its ability to rev higher,[46] and over a V12 for its lower reciprocating mass,[19][46] allowing for more rapid engine response. Lexus claimed their engine could rev from idle to its redline in 0.6 seconds and an analog tachometer needle could not accurately track the LFA's changes in engine speeds. This necessitated the use of a digital tachometer which can instantly display engine speed.[57] The engine reportedly weighs less than the manufacturer's own 3.5-litre 2GR-FE V6 engine. Engineers attempted to make the engine sound like that of a Formula One car with high revs, while at the same time maintaining reliability and vibration control. Along with other manufacturers such as Ferrari, Toyota had produced its own F1 engines and chassis designs.[18] The exhaust note has been described by Toyota engineers as the "roar of an angel",[58] and a US television spot later used the engine sound to shatter a champagne glass via resonance frequency.[59]

The powerplant gives the LFA a weight-to-power ratio of 2.67 kg/hp and enables it to reach a top speed of around 325 km/h (202 mph).[60] Unlike the IS F's 2UR-GSE engine, Yamaha co-developed the entire engine, and not just the cylinder heads. The engine exceeds Euro V emissions. The engine is installed with a front mid-engine placement.[61] According to Chief Engineer Haruhiko Tanahashi a front engine layout was selected instead of a mid engine layout as it is inherently more forgiving dynamically, affording less experienced drivers a wider safety net.[62]

   <p>

    The gearbox built by Aisin is a six-speed single-clutch automated manual transmission actuated with paddle-shifters.[63]

Chassis
The Lexus LFA's frame is made from an in-house designed and manufactured carbon fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP) centre monocoque with aluminium front and rear subframes. The subframes, which can be removed and replaced minimising potential repair costs, are joined to the monocoque using a newly developed aluminum flanged collar designed to create a stronger joint.[4] According to the manufacturer, the quality of the CFRP material matches that of aeronautical grades and is woven by a laser monitored circular loom, one of only two in the world.[44] Overall 65% of the vehicle's total body mass is CFRP material while the remaining 35% is aluminum.[7] Manufacturer data indicates that the use of CFRP saves 100 kg (220 lb) over equivalent aluminum materials.


LFA chassis cutaway display
An electric power steering rack with a 14.3:1 gear ratio is used. The front suspension utilises a double-wishbone arrangement and there is a multi-link arrangement at the rear with coil-over dampers at all wheels. The dampers are a monotube design, each with a remote fluid reservoir that includes an expanding and contracting bellows: a purely mechanical system. The LFA further features six-piston front and four-piston rear Brembo monobloc brake calipers with 390 mm (15.4 in) front and 360 mm (14.2 in) rear carbon ceramic discs controlled by Toyota's Electronically Controlled Brake-by-wire system. Forged 20-inch BBS wheels fitted with 265 mm (10.4 in) front and 305 mm (12.0 in) rear Bridgestone next-generation Potenza tyres are standard.[61] The LFA is equipped with a three-mode Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management (VDIM) stability control system with Sport setting.[49]

To maintain a near-ideal weight distribution, a rear transaxle is used, in addition to the mounting of the fuel tank ahead of the rear axle and the radiators at the rear. The windshield washer fluid reservoir is mounted in the center next to the fuel tank to improve further the center of weight. Overall 48% of the LFA's mass is distributed along with the front wheels with 52% at the rear.[64] The 73 L (16 imp gal; 19 US gal) fuel tank straddles the exhaust system keeping weight centered along the left-right axis. The engine is connected to the transaxle via a rigid carbon-fibre torque tube which the exhaust system runs directly below.[4] This stacked driveshaft and exhaust arrangement decreases the width of the centre tunnel allowing for centrally located seating.
